# CSC8600 Final Project

Small business requires a low cost way of building a web site linked to a database of stock. The web page should provide information drawn from a database, including price and availability. Shoppers should be able to use shopping cart, save the shopping list and use the shopping list for orders later on.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Setup

First you need to install PHP on your system, the easiest way I found was to install WAMP. http://www.wampserver.com/en/

Next install git from https://git-scm.com/downloads
Open a terminal and type "git --version" and ensure it returns a version number. This confirms it has installed and is working correctly.

Next install Node from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Open a terminal and type "npm --version" and ensure it returns a version number. This confirms it has installed and is working correctly.

Next install Composer from https://getcomposer.org/download/
Open a terminal and type "composer --version" and ensure it returns a version number. This confirms it has installed and is working correctly.

Next clone the repo. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you would like to save the project. Now type "git clone https://github.com/davidparker1986/csc8600"
